Many monitoring systems need to send a message to human recipient in a reliable way.
The arapim project provides the engine to try different message sending paths in
effort to deliver the message. 

There is no single SMS provider that works perfectly in every country in
the world. Thus, for attaining truly global SMS coverage, one must use
several SMS providers.

The application automatically detects best available SMS provider for a
given phone number and uses it to send the SMS.
